However, I do enjoy frontend development as well (especially when there is a UI/UX designer providing specs! ). \n\n I currently work at the University of Copenhagen in the Center for Protein Research as an 'IT Officer'. I'm still not sure what that means, but, I help researchers, postdocs, PHD and master students with code and believe it or not, printers too! \n\n I also work on various medical web applications which collect, analyze, and output data.",

The goal was to be able to track more information than the current MSAccess database can, with improved performance. \n\n The system currently keeps track of about 12 million blood/plasma samples and provides full audit trails about all edits, shipments, and aliquots of samples. It is also robust and lightweight, allowing lab personnel to very quickly scan sample barcodes whilst maintaing strict rules for valid sample IDs and uniqueness in the database.",
